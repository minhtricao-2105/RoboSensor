## Description:
In this innovative project, we will use Universal Robot UR3 to perform pick and place task. Initially, we positioned six dice (comprising two blue, two red, and two yellow ones) on the table. To facilitate the process, we integrated an RGB camera to accurately detect the color of each dice, subsequently utilizing image plane coordinates to compute the translation of each dice in the camera's frame. Utilizing the acquired data, we transformed the target points back to the robot's end effector, enabling us to utilize the RMRC (Robot Motion Planning and Control) technique to generate a path from the current pose to the desired pose. In the final stage, leveraging the color information detected by the camera, the UR3 robot efficiently move the dice to pre-defined locations corresponding to their respective colors.
